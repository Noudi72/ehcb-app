# EHC Biel-Bienne Team App - Recent Updates

## New Features Implemented

### 1. User Management - Delete Functionality
**Location:** UserManager.jsx
- Added delete button for each user in the user management table
- Coaches can now permanently delete players from the system
- Includes confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
- Helpful for removing test users or players who leave the club

### 2. Player Reflections - Delete Functionality
**Location:** ReflexionDashboard.jsx
- Added delete button for each reflection entry
- Coaches can now remove old test reflections or unwanted entries
- Includes confirmation dialog for safety
- Automatically refreshes the list after deletion

### 3. Cardio Manager & Tabata Timer Integration
**Issue Fixed:** Changes made in CardioManager were not reflected in TabataTimer
**Solution:** 
- Added cardio-programs to database (db.json)
- Updated CardioProgram.jsx to fetch data from API instead of hardcoded array
- Updated CardioManager.jsx to use database operations
- Now changes in CardioManager are immediately available in TabataTimer

### 4. Background Image Support (Ready for Implementation)
**Location:** Home.jsx
- Added infrastructure for background image with 30% opacity
- Currently commented out until actual joder.jpg image is provided
- When image is available, simply uncomment the background div and place joder.jpg in public folder

## Database Updates

### New cardio-programs collection added to db.json:
```json
{
  "cardio-programs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Grundlagenausdauer",
      "description": "Aufbau der aeroben Ausdauer mit langen Einheiten",
      "workouts": [...]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified:
1. `/src/pages/UserManager.jsx` - Added deleteUser function and delete buttons
2. `/src/pages/ReflexionDashboard.jsx` - Added deleteReflection function and delete buttons  
3. `/src/pages/CardioProgram.jsx` - Updated to fetch from API with loading states
4. `/src/pages/CardioManager.jsx` - Updated to use database operations
5. `/src/pages/Home.jsx` - Added background image infrastructure (commented)
6. `/db.json` - Added cardio-programs collection

## To Add Background Image:
1. Place `joder.jpg` image in `/public/` folder
2. Uncomment the background image div in Home.jsx (lines 11-19)
3. The image will appear with 30% opacity behind the content

## Testing:
- All delete functions include confirmation dialogs
- Loading states are implemented for better UX
- Database operations are properly handled with error catching
- Changes are immediately reflected across components

## Next Steps:
- Add the actual joder.jpg background image when available
- Monitor delete functionality in production
- Consider adding bulk delete options if needed
